    Attributes
    ----------
    buffer_ratio : float
        The buffer ratio of the grid, i.e. how many empty bins are there in the grid.
        Note that empty bins are not the same as empty grid spaces. Value is between 0
        and 1.
    z_size : int
        The height of the grid in number of bins.
    grid_data : pandas.DataFrame
        The grid data previously imported as an Excel file..
    stations : List[str]
        The stations string from the grid data. Example inputs are "P1I", "P2DI", "P3PO".
    number_of_bins : int
        The number of bins in the grid.
    has_inbound : bool
        True if the grid has inbound stations, False otherwise.
    has_outbound : bool
        True if the grid has outbound stations, False otherwise.
    station_code_groups : List[List[int]]
        The list of groups of station indices. A station group means that the stations
        share the same order.
    desired_skycar_directions : pandas.DataFrame
        The desired skycar directions input to be processed as skycar direction
        constraints.

                - Free stack: Any numeric value (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
                - Stations: "P + station code + optional D/P + ends withO/I" (e.g. 
                P1I, P21DI, P2PI, P3DO, P3PO) 
                - Buffers: "B" 
                - Others: Any other characters not defined above
                - Unavailable stack: Left empty

                **1. Free stack** 

                Free stacks are the cells that bins can be placed into. The numeric 
                value given is the depth of the stack in bins.

                **2. Stations**

                Stations are the cells that bins can be picked from and dropped into. 
                They are cells that start with "P", and must follow the pattern 
                "P + station code + optional D/P + O/I". The optional "D" or "P" 
                indicates the station port is for drop or pick, while the last mandatory 
                character "I" or "O" indicates the station is for inbound or outbound 
                operation.

                If the station is for both pick and drop, the optional D/P is not 
                required. For example, "P1O" and "P100I".

                If the station port is for pick only, then the character P is required. For 
                example, "P2PI", "P30PO". Likewise, if the station port is for drop only, then 
                the character D is required. For example, "P2DI", "P50DO". 

                Note that the pick and drop ports must come in pair. In other words, 
                if "P1PI" is created, then there must be "P1DI", and vice versa.  

                Each station must be assigned inbound "I" or outbound "O" as the last 
                character. If the station has two ports, then both ports must have the 
                same inbound or outbound character. For example, "P3DI" and "P3PI" are 
                valid, but "P3DI" and "P3PO" are invalid.

                No two stations can share the same station code, unless they are 
                separate drop and pick ports. For example, if "P1I" exists, then "P1DI" 
                or "P1PI" is invalid, and vice versa. 

                **3. Buffers**

                Buffers are the cells that bins cannot be placed into, but skycars can 
                travel across. They are denoted as "B".

                **4. Others**

                All other characters that are not defined above are considered as 
                others. They are treated as unavailable stacks in the simulation. You may 
                use this to represent chargers, obstacles, etc.

                **5. Unavailable stack**

                Unavailable stacks are the cells that are not used in the grid. They 
                should be left empty.
